## What are Classes?

Classes in School CRM represent organized groups of students studying together under specific academic parameters. Each class is defined by its medium of instruction, stream, shift, and section, creating a structured learning environment.

### Class Components

- **Medium**: Language of instruction (English, Hindi, etc.)
- **Stream**: Academic specialization (Science, Commerce, Arts)
- **Shift**: Timing schedule (Morning, Afternoon, etc.)
- **Section**: Subdivision within a class (A, B, C, etc.)
