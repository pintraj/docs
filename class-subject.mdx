## What are Class Subjects?

Class subjects represent the academic courses taught in each class. They form the foundation of your school's curriculum and determine what students learn in each grade level and stream. Each subject is associated with specific classes, teachers, and academic requirements.

### Subject Categories

- **Core Subjects**: Mandatory subjects for all students (Mathematics, Science, English)
- **Stream Subjects**: Specialized subjects based on academic streams (Physics, Commerce, Literature)
- **Elective Subjects**: Optional subjects students can choose (Computer Science, Art, Music)
- **Language Subjects**: Communication and language skills (English, Hindi, Foreign Languages)
