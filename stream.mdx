# Stream Management

Academic streams are the foundation of your school's curriculum structure. In School CRM, you can create and manage different academic streams such as **Science**, **Commerce**, and **Arts** to organize your students and classes effectively.

## What are Academic Streams?

Academic streams represent the different educational pathways or specializations that students can choose from. Each stream typically has its own set of subjects, curriculum requirements, and career focus areas.

### Common Academic Streams

- **Science Stream**: Focuses on Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology
- **Commerce Stream**: Emphasizes Business Studies, Accountancy, Economics
